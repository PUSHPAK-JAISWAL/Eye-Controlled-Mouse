# Security Policy

The EyeController project is primarily a hobbyist and accessibility-focused tool. While we strive to maintain secure code, it is not subject to continuous professional security audits.

## Supported Versions

Since this project does not have formal version releases, we do not have specific supported versions. Users are encouraged to always use the latest commit from the `main` branch, as this will contain the most recent bug fixes and updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it immediately. Your assistance in helping us secure the project is greatly appreciated.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities directly via email to the project maintainer:

**Email:** `pushpakmjaiswal@gmail.com`

When reporting, please include the following details:

1.  A clear description of the vulnerability.
2.  The steps required to reproduce the issue.
3.  The potential impact of the vulnerability.
4.  Any suggested mitigation or fix (if known).

### Response

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 72 hours. We will then work to confirm the issue and prioritize a fix. We appreciate your patience as this is maintained on a volunteer basis.
